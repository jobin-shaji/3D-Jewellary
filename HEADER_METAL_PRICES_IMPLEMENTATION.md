# Header Metal Prices Implementation

## Overview
Added live gold and silver price display to the header component using the existing `useMetalPrices` hook from the admin section.

## Changes Made

### 1. Header Component Updates (`frontend/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`)

#### New Imports
- Added `useMetalPrices` hook from `@/hooks/admin/useMetalPrices`
- Added `TrendingUp` and `TrendingDown` icons from Lucide React

#### Metal Prices Integration
- Integrated the `useMetalPrices` hook to fetch live gold and silver prices
- Extracted gold (AU) and silver (AG) prices from the metal prices data

#### Responsive Design Implementation

1. **Extra Large Screens (xl+)**: Full metal price cards with:
   - Metal symbol (AU/AG)
   - Current price
   - Trend indicator (up/down arrow)
   - Percentage change with color coding
   - Gradient backgrounds (gold for AU, gray for AG)
   - Tooltips showing full price information

2. **Large Screens (lg to xl)**: Compact version with:
   - Metal symbol and price only
   - Simple background colors
   - Tooltips showing detailed information

3. **Mobile/Tablet Screens**: In the mobile menu with:
   - Section title "Live Metal Prices"
   - Side-by-side cards showing both metals
   - Full information including trend indicators
   - Responsive card layout

#### Visual Design Features

- **Gold Styling**: Yellow gradient backgrounds with yellow-themed colors
- **Silver Styling**: Gray gradient backgrounds with gray-themed colors
- **Trend Indicators**: Green for positive change, red for negative change
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading animations while data loads
- **Accessibility**: Proper tooltips and aria labels

## Features

### Live Data Display
- Real-time gold and silver prices
- Percentage change indicators
- Visual trend arrows
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes (via useMetalPrices hook)

### Responsive Behavior
- **XL+ screens**: Full cards with all information
- **LG screens**: Compact cards with essential info
- **Mobile**: Detailed view in mobile menu

### Visual Indicators
- **Gold**: Displayed with yellow/gold theming
- **Silver**: Displayed with gray/silver theming
- **Positive changes**: Green arrows and text
- **Negative changes**: Red arrows and text

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. `useMetalPrices` hook fetches metal price data
2. Component filters for gold (AU) and silver (AG) prices
3. Prices are displayed responsively across screen sizes
4. Loading states show skeleton animations

### Styling Approach
- Uses Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design
- Gradient backgrounds for visual appeal
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Color-coded trend indicators

### Performance Considerations
- Only renders when data is available
- Efficient re-renders with React hooks
- Loading states prevent layout shifts
- Responsive classes minimize bundle size

## Usage

The metal prices will automatically appear in the header when:
1. The metal prices data is successfully loaded
2. Gold and/or silver prices are available in the data
3. The user's screen size determines which version is shown

### Desktop Experience
Users see live gold and silver prices with full details including trend indicators.

### Mobile Experience
Users can access detailed metal price information in the mobile menu.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Click-to-Expand**: Add click handlers to show more detailed metal information
2. **More Metals**: Include platinum and palladium prices
3. **Time Series**: Show historical price charts on hover/click
4. **Alerts**: Allow users to set price alerts
